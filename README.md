## Credits

The name of this project and the graphical user interface (GUI) design were inspired by [Zer0Condition's ReverseKit](https://github.com/zer0condition/ReverseKit). I greatly admired the structure and aesthetic of ReverseKit, which influenced this project.

Special thanks to Zer0Condition for their exceptional work on ReverseKit.
